Design Goals
============
ical2org-two does not support the full RFC 2445 iCalandar specification and will
most likely never do so. The goals for this project are, in order of importance:

- Support all dates configurable through Google Calendar
- Support all dates configurable through Office 365
- Support custom tagging through cli configuration
- Support filtering through cli configuration
- Support full iCalendar specifications
